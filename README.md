# Strivers A2Z DSA Sheet Repository

Welcome to my repository for the Strivers A2Z DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) sheet! In this repository, I am committed to solving at least one problem every day from the Strivers A2Z DSA sheet. This practice is aimed at enhancing my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and overall proficiency in data structures and algorithms.

## Overview

- **Sheet Source**: [ Strivers A2Z DSA Sheet ](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)
- **Daily Commitment**: Solve at least 1 problem every day

## Progress

I have already completed **118 problems** within the initial 30-40 days of starting this repository. This progress demonstrates my dedication to consistent learning and improvement in the realm of data structures and algorithms.

## Daily Progress

I will be updating the repository daily with the problems I solve. The structure of the repository will be organized in a way that makes it easy for anyone to navigate and find specific problems or solutions.

## Contributions and Discussions

Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements to existing solutions, providing alternative approaches, or introducing new problems. Discussions and collaborations are highly encouraged to foster a learning community around this repository.

## Folder Structure

- **Problem Category **: will have solution of each problem in that category.
  - **Problem statement**: You can go to the official sheet site.
  - **Solution **: My solution to the problem -- most of them are in order of brute force > better > optimal.
  



You can refer to this repo for missing solution that are easy and beginner friendly.
Let's embark on this journey of continuous learning and improvement together!

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
